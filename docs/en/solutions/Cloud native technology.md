# Cloud native technology: the core architecture for building modern applications

![Schematic diagram of cloud native technology stack](docs/en/assets/ymyzd.png)  

## ðŸ“Œ What is cloud native?
Cloud Native is a methodology for building and running applications that fully utilizes the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model to achieve elastic scaling, high availability, and fast iteration. It includes four pillars: containerization, microservices, DevOps, and continuous delivery.

###Key features
1. **Containerized encapsulation**: Implementing environment consistency and resource isolation through containers (such as Docker)
2. **Microservice Architecture**: Breaking down monolithic applications into independently deployed small services
3. **Dynamic orchestration**: Automated management of container lifecycle (such as Kubernetes)
4. **Declarative API**: Define the expected system state through YAML/JSON
5. **immutable infrastructure**: rebuild the runtime environment with each update instead of modifying it

##  ðŸš€  Comparison Table of Core Components
|Technical field | Mainstream tools | Core functions | Applicable scenarios|
|----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Container runtime | Docker, containerd, CRI-O | Application packaging and standardized runtime environment | Consistency assurance for development/testing/production environments|
|**Orchestration Engine**| Kubernetes, Docker Swarm | Container Cluster Scheduling, Scaling, and Self healing | Large scale Container Cluster Management|
|**Service Mesh** | Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect | Inter Service Communication, Security Policy, Traffic Management | Microservice Governance and Observation|
| **CI/CD**      | Argo CD, Jenkins, GitLab CI      |  Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline | Continuous delivery and rolling updates|
|Monitoring logs | Prometheus, Grafana, EFK Stack | Indicator collection, visualization, log aggregation | System observability and fault diagnosis|

##  ðŸ”§  Technical Practice Guide
### 1. Containerized deployment process
```bash
#Building Docker Images
docker build -t my-app:v1 .
#Push to the mirror repository
docker push my-registry.com/my-app:v1
#Kubernetes deployment
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
